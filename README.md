# Motivation
Anti-UAV is still a meaningful and challenging work.
Anti-UAV datasets mainly focus on single-target scenarios currently. However, in real-world applications, there is a growing demand to simultaneously track multiple drones. Also, incorporating multi-objective tracking capabilities is crucial for improving the generalization ability of the tracker.
