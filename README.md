# Motivation
- Currently, There are many high-quality Anti-UAV datasets for object detection and tracking. They mainly focus on single-target scenarios. However, in real-world applications, there is a growing demand to simultaneously track multiple drones. It is necessary to create datasets for multi-object UAV dataset. 

- When tracking multiple targets, Anti-UAV task encounters more challenges: shielded from other UAVs, unknown number of drones, similiar appearance and so on. Incorporating multi-objective tracking capabilities is crucial for improving the generalization ability of the tracker.

# Anti-MUAV15
- Anti-MUAV15 dataset is designed for Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) task, with each sequence containing 1-3 targets, presenting a varied and challenging scenario for tracking.
There are 15 infrared sequences in Anti-MUAV15, each sequence contains 1000-2000 images. Labels for each sequence are located in its corresponding image folder.

- The dataset encompasses scenes featuring buildings, sky, trees and so on.
