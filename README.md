# Anti-MUAV15
Anti-MUAV15 dataset is designed for AntiUAV task, with each sequence containing 1-3 targets, presenting a varied and challenging scenario for tracking.
Anti-MUAV15 comprises 15 infrared sequences, with each sequence containing 1000-2000 images. The dataset encompasses scenes featuring buildings, sky, trees and so on.

# Motivation
Anti-UAV is still a meaningful and challenging work.
Anti-UAV datasets mainly focus on single-target scenarios currently. However, in real-world applications, there is a growing demand to simultaneously track multiple drones. Also, incorporating multi-objective tracking capabilities is crucial for improving the generalization ability of the tracker.
