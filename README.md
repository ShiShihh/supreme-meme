# Motivation
- Currently, There are many high-quality Anti-UAV datasets for object detection and tracking. They mainly focus on single-target scenarios. However, in real-world applications, there is a growing demand to simultaneously track multiple drones. It is necessary to create datasets for multi-object UAV dataset. 

- When tracking multiple targets, Anti-UAV task encounters more challenges: shielded from other UAVs, unknown number of drones, similiar appearance and so on. Incorporating multi-objective tracking capabilities is crucial for improving the generalization ability of the tracker.

# Anti-MUAV15
- Anti-MUAV15 dataset is designed for Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) task, with each sequence containing 1-3 targets, presenting a varied and challenging scenario for tracking.
There are 15 infrared sequences in Anti-MUAV15, each sequence contains 1000-2000 images. Labels for each sequence are located in its corresponding image folder.

- The dataset encompasses scenes featuring buildings, sky, trees and so on.
In addition to the challenges encountered in single UAV tracking, such as tiny target, blurred vision, changes in visual perspective, and noise, Anti-MUAV15 also presents challenges such as occlusion between objects and similar appearances.
